___

### Project 1: Mental health in LGBTQ asylum seekers

We are conducting a survey study about mental health and healthcare access among LGBTQ asylum seekers in the U.S. Our goal is to describe the epidemiology of mental health problems in this population and their access to treatment.

### Project 2: Effectiveness of a training intervention for emergency room staff in Tanzania

We are evaluating the effectiveness of a staff traning intervention (developed and implemented by Sam) in improving clinical practice and outcomes for patients with traumatic brain injuries.
