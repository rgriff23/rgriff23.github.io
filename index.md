<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

I am a data scientist on the performance marketing team at [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/). In addition, I recently joined the Northeastern [Masters of Professional Studies in Analytics Program](https://pages.northeastern.edu/ALYMPSAPSCH2017-07PaidSearch_LPFA.html?utm_campaign=mofu-niche&utm_medium=search&utm_source=google&utm_content=c&campaign=MPS_in_Analytics&adgroup=Branded&keyword=%2Bnortheastern%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bmaster=program=a2j1a000000E711AAC&gclid=Cj0KCQiAnY_jBRDdARIsAIEqpJ2wx6cbyKEpoldVfwvVWGJU2GHsV8H-lg9jSROgbK5pVd6SVIxZwscaAvNWEALw_wcB) as a lecturer.

Before KAYAK, I was a Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/), a program designed to help PhDs land industry jobs. Before that, I got my PhD in [Evolutionary Anthropology](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/) from Duke University, where my research focused on the ecology and evolution of primate morphology, behavior, and infectious disease. 

I'm always on the lookout for exciting opportunities to apply and expand my data science skills. In addition, I'm passionate about paying it forward through outreach, mentorship, and pro bono work.
