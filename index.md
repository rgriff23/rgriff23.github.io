<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

I am a Data Scientist on the marketing optimization team at [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/). I also love teaching and moonlight as an analytics lecturer at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/analytics/). 

Increasingly, I've been seeking ways to leverage my skills to advance the [progressive movement](https://www.guide.progressivedatajobs.org/02_what_is_prog_analytics). Current activities include:

1. Contributing to the open source Python library [Parsons](https://move-coop.github.io/parsons/html/index.html), which provides core data infrastructure for the progressive movement. 
2. Serving as a Data Consultant to [Stand Up America](https://www.standupamerica.com/), providing voter data pulls and dashboarding to support their get-out-the-vote effort for the 2020 presidential election.
3. Participating in the [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org/) community, which helps connect technology workers with the organizations that need them the most.

Previously, I earned my PhD in [Human Evolutionary Biology](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/) from Duke University, where I studied the ecology and evolution of primates.
